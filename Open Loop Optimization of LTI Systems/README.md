# Basics of Open Loop Optimization of LTI Systems

Read the __"Open Loop Optimization of LTI Systems"__ PDF to get an overview over the full space and reduced space approaches to dynamic optimization, and try out the provided example scripts and play around!

This is not related to the rest of the QP-repository, but I added it here.
I wrote this quickly, and there may be errors. If you find any, let me know ðŸ™‚
If you have any questions, or would like me to add something, please contact me. Either by mail: tagabrie@ntnu.no, or by some other means.

The example script uses the functions found in the "MATLAB Functions" folder, but they are also included directly in the script.

#### Do NOT use the functions from the "MATLAB Functions" folder for MPC purposes if they have to be used on-line!! They are written to be easy to understand for beginners, and not to be fast.
