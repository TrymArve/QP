# Basics of Open Loop Optimization of LTI Systems

This is not related to the rest of the QP-repository, but I added it here.
I wrote this quickly, and there may be errors. If you find any, let me know ðŸ™‚
If you have any questions, of would like me to add something, please contact me. Either by mail: tagabrie@ntnu.no, or by some other means.
